## Overview
I created a FAQ accordion, it is a common front-end user interface pattern that organizes Frequently Asked Questions in a collapsible format. Typically implemented as a list of questions where clicking on an item reveals or hides its corresponding answer, it offers a space-efficient and user-friendly way to present information on a website. This interactive design allows users to easily navigate through a set of questions and quickly access the relevant answers without overwhelming the interface.

### The challenge
Users should be able to:
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### My process
Having downloaded all the assets and Figma design, I meticulously analyzed the designs to identify differences and similarities. I aimed to organize my code more effectively, considering techniques that could enhance the overall structure. Following this, I began writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes, adopting a desktop-first approach. I incorporated a recap of DOM JS into this project to ensure a comprehensive implementation.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design workflow

### What I learned
Recently, I completed a JavaScript course where I gained knowledge about concepts such as classes, objects, and the Document Object Model (DOM). Despite this, I hadn't applied my learning until now. This marks my inaugural use of Target Events in projectsâ€”a modest yet significant step for a frontend developer. I am appreciative of the progress I've made and eager to see how my skills develop over time.

### Continued development
As a programming novice, my primary focus will be on integrating JavaScript into my projects and enhancing the responsiveness of my websites. While I am also interested in CSS, I plan to delve deeper into it once I feel more confident with JavaScript. My goal is to master animation, transitions, and transformations, recognizing their powerful role in creating high-quality projects.
